## About the Character

Monkey D. Garp is a legendary Vice Admiral in the "One Piece" series, renowned for his immense strength and unique personality. He is one of the most powerful figures in the Navy, often referred to as "Garp the Hero" for his role in cornering the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Despite his high rank and dedication to justice, Garp is known for his laid-back attitude and tendency to act unconventionally.

Garp is also the grandfather of the protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, and the father of the revolutionary leader, Monkey D. Dragon.

I chose this character because "One Piece" is my favorite show.
